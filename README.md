# F1_Project (Ongoing)
Personnal Project about Formula One Championship

With a dataset availabale on Kaggle, posted by Vopani, I will answer a few question about the probability of winning for a driver or a constructor under some circumstances. For example:

- Is there a "must win" circuit in the championship? Either a particular Grand Prix or the N-th circuit of the championship.
- Probability of winning the circuit when starting in pole position.
- Which is the position on the grid who leads more to an abandon?
- Probability of winning the circuit when doing the best lap.

For this project I will take the Champhionship from 2010, which is the year where the new points system has been implemented.
